# Claude Marketplace

## Adding a New Plugin

Create only:

```text
plugins/<name>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json
```

Everything else is automated:

- `marketplace.json` - synced by CI
- `release-please-config.json` - generated by CI
- Version bumps - handled by Release Please

## plugin.json Template

```json
{
  "name": "plugin-name",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "What this plugin does",
  "author": {
    "name": "Dawid Nitka",
    "email": "contact@dawidnitka.com"
  },
  "keywords": ["relevant", "tags"]
}
```

## Commit Convention

Use conventional commits for automatic versioning:

- `feat:` → minor bump
- `fix:` → patch bump
- `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` → major bump

## Code Style

Inherit from base-setup plugin CLAUDE.md:

- pnpm as default package manager
- No AI attribution in commits
- Simple, readable code - no over-engineering
